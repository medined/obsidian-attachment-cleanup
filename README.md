# obsidian-attachment-cleanup

When I copy a page, the images are copied as well. But I might remove the reference. The copied image remains.


## Prompt

i am using the obsidian text editor. Most of the files are markdown files with .md file extensions. Images are referenced using this syntax:

![[Lecture 9.1 - How Expressive are Graph Networks_image_1.png|800]]

The images are located in /home/medined/Dropbox/david/fences/Attachments.

The markdown files are located in /home/medined/Dropbox/david/ and sub-directories.

I want to generate a list of attachment files that are not referenced by the markdown files.

I want the list to be generated by python.
